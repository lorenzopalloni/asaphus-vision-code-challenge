### Code challenge
Write a Python script that reads an image from a file as grayscale, and finds
the four non-overlapping 5x5 patches with highest average brightness. Take
the patch centers as corners of a quadrilateral, calculate its area in
pixels, and draw the quadrilateral in red into the image and save it in PNG
format. Use the opencv-python package for image handling. Write test cases.
